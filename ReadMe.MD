Coffee Jelly

Its lively and chewy,and also gives a bitter taste but when cream or milk is added its flavour enhances and gives a creamy taste. The aroma of ground coffee mixed with the sweetness of cream is a once in life time taste. Some say it has a fluffy texture, but it really depends on th individual. Its a perfect summer snack but can be eaten in winter, not to mention it can be also a drink. If you like coffee i highly recommend this recipe on Coffee Jelly. :)
